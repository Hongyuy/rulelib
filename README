These are tools to experiment with representations and approaches to handling
rulesets.

makedata.py: Transform data sets into something I can easily read into a C program
	in which I can manipulate the data

analyze.c:	Routines to read in the data from makedata, create random rulesets,
		and perform additions, removals, and swaps on said rulesets.

Logic of capture management:

1. Remove ith rule from a ruleset

foreach j > i
	let caught = j.tt & i.captures
	j.captures = j.captures | caught
	i.captures & ~caught

2. Add a rule (n) into the ith slot of a ruleset (sliding those in slots > i
down one).

caught = forall j < i j.captures
n.captures = n.tt & ~caught
foreach j > i
	j.captures = j.captures & ~n.captures


3. Swap see code

TODO: I don't think I need two sets of vector operations -- (right now
I have pure vector and then some with rule and vector)  Pure vector will
also be better for converting to GMP
