These are tools to experiment with representations and approaches to handling
rulesets.

makedata.py: Transform data sets into something easily read into a C program
	Assumes input files in the *.TAB and *.Y formats and produces a .out
	format of <rule, truthtable> tuples where entry i in the truthtable
	contains either an ascii 1 or ascii 0 indicating if the rule applies to the 
	ith sample in the training data.

analyze.c:	Routines to read in the data from makedata, create random rulesets,
		and perform additions, removals, and swaps on said rulesets.

rulelib.c:	Library of routines for manipulating rules and rulesets.


Compile options:

This package compiles both with and without the GMP library.  Without it, bit vector
operations are coded manually; with GMP, we leverage the high performance bit vector
operations.
